#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|See the displayed objectives and features of the map, then select either of the maps displayed,  then click on next button.  |Display objective and maps used in the experiment. | Recall the experiment.
2.|Click on Get Paper the paper will be placed along the profile. Click on Mark Point to mark the point of intersection of contour lines along the profile. The corresponding X-Y coordinate for each point on the profile will be displayed. Click next button to proceed. |Display points obtained by the intersection of dotted lines or solid lines with the XY of contour map. | To observe how readings of the points are taken along the profile.
3.|Click on Plot X-Axis and Plot X-Axis to get axis over the graph displayed. Click on Points on X-Axis and Points on Y-Axis to get the X and Y scale reading. Click next button to proceed. |Display the X-Axis and Y-Axis taking X as origin and define scale. | Preparing the graph to be plotted.
4.|Click on Define Coordinates, the X-Y coordinates of the graph will be displayed. Click on each point on profile for it to appear on the graph shown. Click next button to proceed. |Display the points as a, b, c… respectively taking its distance from X as X coordinate and index value of the corresponding line as Y coordinate. |To plot the coordinates of the points on a graph.
5.|Click on Plot Y’ and Join Points to get a graph over the plotted points for the  profile. Click next button to proceed. |Display the line perpendicular to X axis passing through Y’, the graph shall bound between the Y Axis and the line through Y’. Join all the plotted points on the graph free hand.  |To plot a graph for the points along profile.
6.|Click on Draw Tunnel at Y= 190, Y=210. Click next button to proceed. |Display a horizontal tunnel to divert the river water at an invert level (floor) at 200 m up to Western Valley in the area. | To see the positioning of tunnel.
7.|Click on a section of contour map where soil index is to be calculated. Click next button to proceed. |Display section of contour map where soil index is to be calculated and the formula to calculate index of the soil. |To understand how to calculate soil index.
8.|Enter the value of M, N, S, and T for the section P of the map shown. Click on Check, click on calculate. Repeat the same steps for section Q and R of the contour maps. Click next button to proceed. |Display sections P, Q and R such that their Y coordinates is the index of the solid lines and the X coordinate to zero. After calculation of soil index display the soil type for section P,Q and R. | To calculate the index of soil and soil type for section P, Q and R.
9.|Click on P (0,150), Q (0,250), R (0,450), Region to analyse the soil structure in different sections of contour maps. Click on Contour map to see the contour map. |Display the lines through P, Q, and R parallel to X Axis and below the curve.  | To observe the soil profile in the different section of maps.
