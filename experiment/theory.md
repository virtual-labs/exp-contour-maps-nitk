### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">A topographic map is a two-dimensional representation of a portion of the three-dimensional surface of the earth. Topography is the shape of the land surface, and topographic maps exist to represent the land surface. These maps are used for geologic studies because they show the configuration of the earthâ€™s surface. Cartographers solve the problem of representing the three-dimensional land surface on a flat piece of paper by using contour lines, thus horizontal distances and vertical elevations can both be measured from a topographic map. Contour lines are curved, straight or a mixture of both lines on a map describing the intersection of a real or hypothetical surface with one or more horizontal planes. The configuration of these contours allows map readers to infer relative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific places. The contour interval of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive contour lines.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><strong>The following are general characteristics of contour lines</strong>:</p>

<ol style="text-indent:25px; text-align:justify;list-style-position: inside">
<li>Contour lines do not cross each other, divide or split.</li>
<li>Closely spaced contour lines represent steep slopes, conversely, contour lines that are spaced far apart represent gentle slopes.</li>
<li>Contour lines trend up valleys and form a "V" or a "U" where they cross a stream.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-indent:25px;text-align:justify">A topographic profile of the earth surface is obtained from topographic profiling. Topographic Profile is a cross-sectional view along a line drawn through a portion of a topographic map.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">A profile may be constructed quickly and accurately across any straight line on a map by following this procedure:</p>
 <ol style="text-indent:25px;text-align:justify;list-style-position:inside;list-style-type:lower-alpha">
  <li>Lay a strip of paper along a line across the area where the profile is to be constructed.</li>
  <li>Mark on the paper the exact place where each contour, stream and hill top crosses the profile line.</li>
  <li>Label each mark with the elevation of the contour it represents.</li>
  <li>Prepare a vertical scale on profile paper by labelling the horizontal lines corresponding to the elevation of each index contour line.</li>
  <li>Place the paper with the labelled contour lines at the bottom of the profile paper and project each contour to the horizontal line of the same elevation.</li>
  <li>Connect the points.</li>
</ol>
